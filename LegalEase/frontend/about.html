      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        LegalEase is an AI-powered contract simplification tool designed to help
        users understand complex legal documents quickly and effectively.
        It leverages advanced technologies such as 
        <strong>Natural Language Processing (NLP)</strong>, <strong>InLegalBERT</strong>, and 
        <strong>Google Gemini</strong> to analyze, summarize, and answer your questions about contracts.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Natural Language Processing (NLP)</em> is a technology that enables computers to understand human language.
        Our specialized NLP model, <strong>InLegalBERT</strong>, has been trained extensively on legal documents,
        making it especially good at understanding the complex language and structure found in contracts.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you ask questions about your contract, our platform uses <strong>Google Gemini</strong>, a powerful AI language model,
        to provide clear, professional, and context-aware answers. This combination ensures high confidence in the accuracy
        and relevance of the information you receive.

      <h2>Confidence and Reliability</h2>
      <p>
        Our AI models are built on large datasets of legal documents and continuously fine-tuned to ensure reliability.
        InLegalBERT's training on millions of Indian legal contracts gives it deep understanding of legal language nuances.
      </p>
      <p>
        Google Gemini complements this by providing sophisticated natural language understanding capabilities for Q&A,
        offering professional, clear, and contextually relevant responses.
      </p>
      <p>
         <strong>While AI assistance substantially speeds up contract review and improves understanding, it is recommended to 
        consult with a legal professional for any critical decisions based on contract interpretations.</strong>
